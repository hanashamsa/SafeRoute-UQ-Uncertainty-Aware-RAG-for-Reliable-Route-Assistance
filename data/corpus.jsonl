Abstract This Work Zone Best Practices Guidebook provides an easily accessible compilation of work zone operations practices used and recommended by various States and localities around the country. The Guidebook is a reference document that can be updated with new approaches, technologies, and practices for effectively managing work zones and reducing the impacts of work zones on mobility and safety as they are identified. The best practices are descriptive, not prescriptive. They describe approaches that have been successfully used by transportation agencies, along with contact information to find out more from the agency using the practice.

Potential pollutants include fuels, oil, antifreeze, brake fluid, solvents, and battery acid. The goal of this written Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to provide guidance to municipal employees to help reduce the discharge of pollutants from the MS4 as a result of leaks from vehicles and equipment. If services are contracted with respect to vehicles and equipment, this SOP should be provided to the contractor. The contract should also specify that the contractor is responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. The City of Haverhill undertakes various procedures in regards to its municipal vehicles and equipment. Within two years of the effective date of the MS4 Permit, the City will create an inventory of all municipal vehicles and equipment and update this inventory annually (refer to the attached vehicles and equipment inventory template). Procedures The City will implement the following procedures for municipally owned and operated vehicles and equipment to reduce the discharge of pollutants from", "source": "operations-and-maintenance-of-municipal-vehicles-and-equipment.pdf", "timestamp": null}

Organizational Structure CyRide operations and maintenance is governed by the Ames Transit Agency. The Transit Agency is an administrative agency of the City of Ames, Iowa established pursuant to Chapter 392, Code of Iowa, 1979. The purpose of the agency is the establishment, acquisition, operation, management, control and governance of transit services in and for the City of Ames. II. Vehicle Maintenance Plan Objective The objective of the CyRide Vehicle Maintenance Plan is to optimize the value of the funded dollar while protecting stakeholder investment. The primary goals of the plan are: \u2022 Maintain vehicles in safe operating condition. \u2022 Ensure each vehicle is operating at peak efficiency. \u2022 Maximize vehicle life. \u2022 Minimize vehicle service failures (road calls). \u2022 Minimize loss of accessibility due to equipment failure. \u2022 Meet or exceed manufacturers\u2019 maintenance requirements. \u2022 Maintain vehicle exterior and interior appearance. \u2022 Maintain a", "source": "sample-large-maintenance-plan.pdf", "timestamp": null}

For mini buses (Ford E series), the intervals are (A) 3,000 miles; (B) 6,000 miles; (C) 12,000 miles; and (D) 24,000 miles. Preventive maintenance inspections are to be performed on time. CyRide defines an on-time inspection as being within (+/-)10 percent of schedule. A list of items inspected at the above intervals can be found on the inspection sheets in the appendix. The mechanic assistant performing the inspection will repair minor defects at the end of the inspection. This includes minor Maintenance Card repairs deferred until inspection. Repairs that can\u2019t be completed in the allotted inspection time are reported to the lead mechanic or Maintenance Coordinator. Generally, any remaining repairs are assigned and completed by another mechanic. If parts are not available and the defect is not safety sensitive, the bus will be released for service and scheduled for repairs at a later date. Brake and tire wear are recorded on a spreadsheet. Repairs are scheduled when wear reaches a predetermined level. CyRide\u2019s tire replacement policy follows", "source": "sample-large-maintenance-plan.pdf", "timestamp": null}

IV. Reactive Vehicle Maintenance All other vehicle maintenance is performed in response to detected problems. Reactive maintenance cannot be eliminated and is often a function of vehicle miles, fleet age, and preventive maintenance intervals. It is the intent of this maintenance program to minimize this type of maintenance \u2013 including road calls. Constantly reviewing and improving upon the existing Vehicle Maintenance Plan will accomplish this.

Lane closure policies and systems can help a State improve mobility by restricting lane closure hours in line with peak travel times and coordi- nating lane closures to manage the combined impacts. Lane closure policies can be overarching, using one policy to describe an entire State or region, or can be broken down to specific corridors and roadways. Lane closure policies specify when and how lanes can be closed (or cannot be closed) for a given stretch of roadway and are typically based on the roadway capacity and demand volumes and how they vary by day and time due to factors such as the commuting patterns of motorists. Such policies are typically communicated in the form of tables or maps showing allowable lane closure times, or through electronic tools that are programmed to determine if proposed lane closures will meet the agency\u2019s policy. The electronic tools (e.g., spreadsheets, online systems) automate the process of calculating when lanes can be closed and still handle the typical traffic volumes", "source": "factsheet17.pdf", "timestamp": null}

Lane closure management systems can be used to facilitate the implementation of a State\u2019s lane closure policies by enabling the State Department of Transportation (DOT) to easily and effectively coordinate, track, and communicate lane closures both within the agency and to the public, media, emergency responders, and others.
